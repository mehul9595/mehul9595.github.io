## Basics of Python

- Not a statically typed language.
- completely object oriented language.
- uses indentation for code blocks instead of {}, tabs and spaces are allowed.
- encourages programmers to write code without boiler plate code.
- interpreter based language.
- every variable in python is object and we don't need to declare them before using it.
- lists are very similar to arrays. they can contain any type of variable, and as many variables as required.

    ``` python
    x = [1, 2, 3]
    ```

    or

    ``` python
    x = []
    x.append(1)
    x.append(2)
    print(x)
    ```

## Basic Operators

- Arithmetic operators - mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, division, multiplication and modulo are supported.
- String operators
- Operators with Lists: using '+' operator to join two lists
- repeating sequences: lists or strings can be repeated. for example, `` print("hello" * 3) `` will print 'hello' 3 times.
